description: Booleans have a value of either false or true.
---

The **boolean** data type, or `bool`, has a value of either `false` or `true`.

## Conditionals

If a value isn't `false` or `nil`, Luau evaluates it as `true` in [conditional statements](./control-structures.md#if-statements). Unlike many other languages, Luau considers both zero and the empty string as `true`.

## Operators

You can formulate complex conditions with [relational](./operators.md#relational) and [logical](./operators.md#logical) operators.
