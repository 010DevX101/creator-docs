Roblox offers a variety of analytics features to help you chart your experience's growth, track user behavior and retention, and find opportunities for optimization. You can use analytics to understand what actions you can take to grow your experience.

## Growing Your Experience with Analytics

Consider following this 3-step plan to use analytics to grow your experience:

<h4>Step 1: Optimize retention, engagement, and monetization</h4>

Before driving too many new users to your experience, grow the following metrics to a level that's comparable to or above the [benchmarks for similar experiences](../../production/analytics/analytics-dashboard.md#benchmarking):

      1.  **D1 (day 1) retention** and **average session time** are key metrics to focus on first because they measure if new users are enjoying and coming back to your experience. For more information on improving this metric, see [Retention](../../production/analytics/retention.md) and [Engagement](../../production/analytics/engagement.md).

      2.  **D7 (day 7)** and **D30 (day 30) retention** measure if users are making progress in your experience and returning long-term. For more information on improving this metric, see [Retention](../../production/analytics/retention.md).

      3.  **Payer conversion rate** and **ARPPU (average revenue per paying user)** measure the effectiveness of your user monetization. It's important to be thoughtful about monetization from the start. For more information on improving this metric, see [Monetization](../../production/analytics/monetization.md).

<h4>Step 2: Drive new user acquisition </h4>

After you have optimized your retention, engagement, and monetization, use your [Acquisition](../../production/analytics/acquisition.md) page to understand:

1. Where new users are coming from by source.
2. How well each source is converting.

You can use the following chart to track your conversion rates from Roblox **Home** and **Search**. Test different experience icons, titles, and descriptions to see how they impact your conversion rate.

Roblox experiences are inherently social, and users love trying them out with their friends. Consider using features like [events](../../production/promotion/events-platform.md) and [player invite prompts](../../production/promotion/invite-prompts.md) to invite users to bring their friends to your experience.

<h4>Step 3: Monitor metrics after each experience update</h4>

After you update your experience, visit analytics to understand how the update impacted the following metrics:

1. [Retention](../../production/analytics/retention.md): D1, D7, and D30 retention.
2. [Engagement](../../production/analytics/engagement.md): Average session time.
3. [Monetization](../../production/analytics/monetization.md): Payer conversion, ARPPU, and revenue.
4. [Acquisition](../../production/analytics/acquisition.md): New users and conversion rates by source.

## Analytics Insights

In each experience's overview page there are three key analytics insights to help you take action:

- **Your metric is lower than 50% of similar experiences:** This insight means that a metric is lower than 50% of similar experience benchmarks. Focus on improving this metric to grow your experience faster.
- **Your metric has increased or decreased week over week:** This insight points to a large percent change in a metric. Visit the chart for the articulated metric and filter through parameters to identify what might have led to the change.
- **Your metric is at a six month high:** This insight is meant to help you celebrate progress when a metric has reached a six month high. Note that if a metric is at a six month high but below benchmark comparisons, you should still continue to improve it.
