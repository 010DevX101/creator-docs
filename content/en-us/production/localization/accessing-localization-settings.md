title: Accessing Localization Settings
description: Explains how to access your experience's localization settings.
---

Your experience's localization settings is the starting place for enabling
translations and accessing your localization tools. You'll need to set your
[source](#setting-source-language) and [supported](#setting-supported-languages)
languages before starting any localization to a new language.

The localization page also includes tools to start translating your experiences, add translation collaborators and download translation analytics. For more information on translating content in your experiences using the localization page, see [Translating In-Experience Content](../../production/localization/translating-in-experience-content.md).

## Accessing the Settings Page

The localization settings can be found on the Roblox website and is only available for published experiences.

To access the localization settings from the Roblox website directly:

1. Navigate to your experience's main page on the Roblox website.
2. Click the **&hellip;** button to the right of your experience title.

## Setting Source Language

Before you can start any localization, Roblox needs to know which language you
are translating from and which languages you are translating to.

The **source language** is the primary language that the
experience has been written in. Roblox currently only supports one source
language at a time. The default is set to **English**.

To set the **source** language:

1. In the [localization settings](#accessing-the-settings-page), navigate to **Languages** and select the **Source Language** dropdown.

2. Select a language from the list.
3. Click **Confirm** to add the language.

## Setting Supported Languages

The **supported languages** are the languages you intend to provide translations
for. You can have multiple supported languages for your experience. See
[language codes](./language-codes.md) for a list of all languages Roblox supports.
To set the **supported** languages:

1. In the [localization settings](#accessing-the-settings-page), navigate to
   **Languages** and select the **Source Language**.
2. In the **Supported Languages** section, click **Add Language** to add the
   languages you intend to localize to.
