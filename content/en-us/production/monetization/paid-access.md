**Paid Access** allows you to charge a **one-time Robux fee** in order for users to access an experience.

This feature limits the number of users that will access your experience, as some users won't want to pay the fee. Many developers temporarily [enable Paid Access](#enabling-paid-access) to create a closed beta so their most engaged users can have early access to an experience to help with testing and feedback.

A Paid Access fee can range between **25 to 1000 Robux**. Once a user pays this fee, they'll continue to have access to that experience even if you increase the price or disable Paid Access. Your Robux earnings from Paid Access purchases go into escrow for up to 7 days before being paid out.

If you enable Paid Access, you can still sell [Game Passes](./game-passes.md), gear, and items within the experience.

  Paid access experiences are not available on Xbox.

## Restrictions

All users with accounts at least 30 days old can [enable paid access](#enabling-paid-access) for their experiences. However, these experiences **cannot**:

- Break any of the [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).

- Only be available to friends or group members. The experience must be available to everyone.

- Have private servers.

- Earn [Engagement-Based Payouts](./engagement-based-payouts.md). However, you can still review the experience's payout score.

- Allow copying from other users. When you enable Paid Access, your experience will automatically disallow copying.

- Be broken or otherwise unplayable. If so, and a larger number of users submit complaints, the experience will be quarantined. The developer will have the opportunity to fix any issues, but any earnings from that experience at the time of quarantine that are still in escrow will be refunded to buyers.
