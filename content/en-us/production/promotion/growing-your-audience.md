Roblox allows creators to engage with their audience to communicate
updates or tease upcoming releases. You can grow your audience on Roblox
with the [Follow](#followers) button, or
you can direct users to follow you on social media by embedding
[social media links](#linking-to-social-media) on your
experience's page. You can also attract a fanbase by posting frequent progress updates
with interesting details on social media. It is recommended to use the
**#RobloxDev** hashtag to highlight your posts to users actively
interested in game development on Roblox.

## Followers

Users become followers by clicking on the **Follow** button on your
experience's main page to opt-in to receive any updates about your
experience, including new content, bug fixes, and major announcements.

When you announce an update, followers
receive a notification in their **Notifications** stream, along with a
link to launch the experience directly from the notification. This keeps
users actively invested in your experience.

## Announcing Updates

Updates have a limit of 60 characters, and you can only announce an
update once every three days. When drafting your update, consider the
following best practices:

- Focus on announcing new, exciting, and accessible information, such
  as new areas, skills, and achievements.
- Be descriptive in your updates. Updates like "bug fixes" are vague
  and don't inform the reader of what was actually fixed.
- Avoid overwhelming users with too many updates in a short time
  period.

To announce an update:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).

2. Click on the experience you want to announce an update for. The experience's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the left-hand navigation, select **Updates**. The **Updates** page displays.

4. In the input field, describe what has been updated in your experience, then click the **PREVIEW** button to see how the update will display for desktop, tablet, and phone users.

5. When ready, click the **SEND** button. The update sends to everyone who follows your experience.

After you send an update, it immediately displays on the **Updates** page with
the name of the sender, the message you sent, and statistics related to
the update's performance.

## Linking to Social Media

experiences. You can add up to 3 social media links. For compliance
reasons, **social links are only visible to 13+ users**.
