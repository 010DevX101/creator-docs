Thumbnails appear at the top of your experience's main page, allowing you to further promote your experience, showcase its features, and announce updates and events. They are the first images and videos users see after clicking on your [experience icon](../../production/publishing/experience-icons.md).

There are two types of thumbnails that you can use to market your experience:

- **Image** &mdash; Supplements the experience icon, such as screenshots of gameplay or slides that demonstrate key details of your experience.

- **Video** &mdash; Links directly to YouTube. Many creators use this type of thumbnail to display trailers.

Images are free to upload while videos have a moderation cost of **500 Robux**.

## Adding Thumbnails

You can add up to 10 images or video links per experience from the [Thumbnails](#opening-the-thumbnails-page) page.

### Images

When you're creating an image to upload, use a template of **1920×1080 pixels** in either `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.png`, `.tga`, or `.bmp` format.

To upload an image from the **Thumbnails** page:

1. Set the media type to **Image** and click the **UPLOAD&nbsp;IMAGE** button. A file browser displays.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/CD-Upload-Image.png" width="600" />

2. Select the image you want to display on your experience's main page, then click the **Open** button. The file browser closes, and a preview of your thumbnail displays.

3. Click the **SAVE CHANGES** button.

Once the moderation team reviews your image thumbnail to ensure it adheres to the [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846), it displays to all users.

### Videos

While you can't directly upload videos to Roblox, you can link to videos you own on YouTube.

To link to a video for a thumbnail in the **Thumbnails** page:

1. Set the media type to **Video**. Additional fields display.

1. In the **YouTube URL** field, enter the URL of the video that you want to display as a video thumbnail, then click the **ADD&nbsp;VIDEO** button

1. Click the **SAVE CHANGES** button.

Once the Moderation team reviews your image thumbnail to ensure it adheres to the [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846), it displays to all users.

### Auto-Generated

In addition to uploading custom image thumbnails, you can let Roblox auto-generate images from the experience itself to showcase your environment designs. Auto-generated thumbnails are based on Studio's camera position for the most recent publish of the place.

To auto-generate an image from the **Thumbnails** page:

1. Set the media type to **Auto-generated image**. A preview displays.

1. Click the **ADD THUMBNAIL** button.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/CD-Create-Auto-Generated.png" width="600" />

1. Click the **SAVE CHANGES** button.

## Ordering Thumbnails

If you upload multiple thumbnails, the experience's main page cycles through them automatically. To change the order of the thumbnail cycle from the **Thumbnails** page:

1. Click-and-hold a thumbnail's order icon.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/Order-Icon.jpg" width="50%" />

2. Drag it up or down. The other thumbnails move according to the thumbnail's new position.

3. Click the **SAVE CHANGES** button.

## Deleting Thumbnails

Once you have uploaded a thumbnail to the **Thumbnails** page, it displays below the preview image with a trash can icon near the right of its tile. To delete a thumbnail:

1. Click the trash can icon. A pop-up window displays asking if you would like to permanently delete the thumbnail.

2. Click the **DELETE** button.

Once you confirm the action, the thumbnail deletes from the queue and from the experience's main page.

## Capturing Thumbnails in Free Camera Mode

Free camera mode is a useful tool to capture in-experience screenshots and videos because it allows you to move the camera to positions that aren't possible when testing or playing under normal circumstances. To enable free camera mode:

1. Navigate to an experience where you have server-side developer console access.

2. In the **Home** tab of the menu bar, navigate to the **Test** section and click **Play**.

3. Press **<kbd>Left Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>**.

Once in free camera mode, you can use the following controls:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Keys/Shortcuts</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera forward/left/back/right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Q</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera down/up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
    <td>In combination with any movement key, changes the camera speed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Right Mouse Button**</td>
    <td>When pressed, dragging the mouse moves the camera view around.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Mouse Scroll Wheel**</td>
    <td>Zooms the camera in or out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd></td>
    <td>Disables all `Class.CoreGui|CoreGuis` but not user-created GUIs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd></td>
    <td>Disables all user-created GUIs but not  `Class.CoreGui|CoreGuis`.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
