To maintain a clean working space on the Roblox website and within Studio, you can **archive** specific content.

## Archiving Assets

You can archive certain asset types from the
[Create](https://www.roblox.com/develop) page on the Roblox website. Note that
**archived assets are not usable in any Roblox experience**, meaning that they will fail to
load and will disappear from the website.

To archive an asset:

1. From the [Create](https://www.roblox.com/develop) page, select **Decals**, **Audio**, or **Meshes**.
1. Locate the asset and select **Configure** from its drop-down context menu.
1. On the asset's configuration page, click the **Archive** button.

### Restoring Archived Assets

To restore an archived asset to the main panel:

1. For applicable asset categories on the [Create](https://www.roblox.com/develop) page, check the **Show Archived** checkbox.
1. Navigate to the asset's configuration page and click the **Restore** button.

## Archiving Games

In addition to archiving assets, you can archive an entire game and remove it from Studio's game list:

1. If any game or place is currently open, close it.
1. Select **My Games** or **Group Games**.
1. Hover over a game's icon and click the **...** button (or right-click the icon).
