The **Developer Console** is a tool for debugging your experience when testing in Studio or running it in production. It shows log messages and errors similar to the Output window and detailed information on [Memory](#memory) and [Networking](#network).

## Opening the Developer Console

To open the **Developer Console** while testing or playing an experience, type `/console` into the chat or press <kbd>F9</kbd>. You can also use the in-experience settings:

1. Open the in-experience **Settings**.
2. Scroll down until you see **Developer Console**.
3. Next to **Developer Console**, click **Open**.

## Console Tabs

The shortcut bar at the top of the console shows the number of critical errors and warnings, client memory usage, and average ping time. Click any of these to jump to its corresponding tab in the console. Below the shortcut bar is a series of tabs, including **Log**, **Memory**, and **Network**.

### Log

The **Log** tab shows diagnostic messages from scripts. It has two sections: **Client** and **Server**.

- The **Client** section shows output from LocalScripts running on the client. Anyone running an experience can view these local output messages.
- The **Server** section shows output from Scripts running on Roblox servers. Only the experience owner or group members with editing permission can access this section.

You can filter the output messages in the log using the following checkboxes:

<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Output</b></td>
      <td>Messages generated by calls to `Global.LuaGlobals.print()` and `Global.RobloxGlobals.warn()` statements within scripts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Information</b></td>
      <td>Messages generated by the experience that aren't errors or custom output statements.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Warning</b></td>
      <td>Messages that indicate a potential problem but not a critical issue.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Error</b></td>
      <td>Messages that indicate that something critical has happened.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Command Bar

The **Server** section has a **Command Bar** that lets users with editing permissions run arbitrary Luau code. This command bar has the same security restrictions as `Class.Script` and `Class.LocalScript` objects, so unlike the command bar in Studio, it can't run protected functions.

### Memory

The **Memory** tab of the console shows metrics on memory usage. Models, terrain, parts, visual effects, scripts, physical contraptions, audio, and more can all contribute to total memory usage. The **Memory** tab has the following section:

- **CoreMemory** &ndash; Memory used by processes built into the Roblox engine such as networking, avatars, and GUI elements.
- **PlaceMemory** &ndash; Memory that scales as a direct result of choices made as an experience is built.
- **UntrackedMemory** &ndash; Arbitrary memory allocations that are not tagged.
- **PlaceScriptMemory** &ndash; Memory used by user Luau script threads. This section includes script names and custom memory tags.
- **CoreScriptMemory** &ndash; Memory used by internal Roblox script threads.

**PlaceMemory** section has sub-categories. The following table describes each sub-category and tips for reducing memory usage.

### Network

The **Network** tab of the Developer Console shows the number of web calls that the experience has made. This includes explicit calls made through `Class.HttpService` and web requests made by Roblox services like `Class.DataStoreService`. The **Network** tab has two sections: **Summary** and **Detail**.

The **Summary** section lists a summary of all the web calls by type. Each type has details on the number of requests, the number of failed requests, and the amount of time that the request took.

The **Details** section lists each individual web call. Each row shows the HTTP method, such as `GET` or `POST`, along with the status code, time to execute, request type, and request URL. Click on web call to see its response details:
