title: Properties Window
description: The Properties window lets you adjust properties of a selected object to change how it looks and behaves.

The **Properties** window, accessible from the [View](../studio/view-tab.md) tab, allows you to adjust certain properties of a selected object to change how the object looks and behaves. Additionally, you can configure [instance attributes](#instance-attributes) at the bottom of the window.

## Header Bar

When you select an object, the window's header bar changes to reflect both the class and name of the object.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/studio/properties/Header-Example-A.png" />
    <figcaption>A model named PizzaRestaurant</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/studio/properties/Header-Example-B.png" />
    <figcaption>A local script named CandleFlicker</figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

## Section Organization

The Properties window divides an object's properties into sections. For example, a `Class.MeshPart` includes sections like **Appearance** and **Collision**, which respectively allow you to change its appearance and how it physically collides with other objects.

You can collapse or expand any section by clicking the small arrow to the left of its name. After you expand or collapse a section, it remains expanded or collapsed for other objects of the same class, as well as related objects that share the same property grouping. For example, the **Pivot** section is common to both `Class.Part|Parts` and `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`.

## Expanding Inputs

Some properties are collapsed by default, but you can expand them by clicking the small arrow next to its name. For instance, `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` contain a **Position** property which represents an X, Y, Z coordinate in the 3D world. In Studio, these coordinates can be entered in two ways:

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/studio/properties/Input-Combined.png" />
    <figcaption>All three coordinates typed into the parent Position field, separated by commas</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/studio/properties/Input-Expanded.png" />
    <figcaption>Property expanded and an individual coordinate typed into the X, Y, or Z field</figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

After you expand or collapse a property, it remains expanded or collapsed for other objects of the same class, as well as related objects that share the same property.

## Filtering Properties

You can filter properties by typing a search query into the **Filter Properties** input near the top of the window. You can quickly access this input by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.

## Instance Attributes

**Attributes** allow you to customize instances with your own data. They are similar to built-in object properties, but you can create and modify your own attributes for any instance. See [Instance&nbsp;Attributes](../studio/instance-attributes.md) for details.
